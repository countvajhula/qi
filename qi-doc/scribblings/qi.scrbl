@title{Qi: A Functional, Flow-Oriented DSL}
@author{Siddhartha Kasivajhula}

@defmodule[qi]

An embeddable, general-purpose language to allow convenient framing of programming logic in terms of functional @emph{flows}.

Start by @seclink["Using_These_Docs"]{getting your bearings}. For an overview of the language, continue to @secref["Introduction_and_Usage"]. For a thorough orientation, @hyperlink["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkIoGmWkEpM"]{watch the original video} from RacketCon 2021.

@section{Using These Docs}

@secref["Introduction_and_Usage"] describes the language and how to optimize your editor of choice to effectively write Qi. Learn the language by going through the @secref["Tutorial"], and read @secref["When_Should_I_Use_Qi_"] for examples illustrating its use. The many ways in which Qi may be used from the host language (e.g. Racket), as well as the ways in which Qi may be used in tandem with other DSLs, are described in @secref["Language_Interface"]. The various built-in forms of the language are documented in @secref["Qi_Forms"], while @secref["Qi_Macros"] covers using macros to extend the language by adding new features or implementing new DSLs. The @secref["Field_Guide"] contains practical advice.
