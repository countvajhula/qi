@title[#:tag "Qi_Forms"]{The Qi Language}

The core syntax of the Qi language. These forms may be used in any flow. Flows may be specified in Racket via the @seclink["Language_Interface"]{language interface}.

@table-of-contents[]

@section{Basic}

@defidform[_]{
  The symbol @racket[_] means different things depending on the context, but when used on its own, it is the identity flow or trivial transformation, where the outputs are the same as the inputs. It is equivalent to Racket's @racket[values].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ _) 3)
    ((☯ _) 1 2)
    ((☯ (-< _ _)) 3)
  ]
}

@defform[(gen expr ...)]{
  A flow that generates the @emph{values} of the provided Racket expressions @racket[expr], ignoring any input values provided to it at runtime. This is the most common way to translate an ordinary value into a flow.

  Note that @seclink["Literals"]{literals} are transparently wrapped with @racket[gen] during @tech/reference{expansion} and don't need to be explicitly wrapped.

  @racket[gen] generalizes @racket[const] in the same way that @racket[values] generalizes @racket[identity].

  Also see @secref["Using_Racket_Values_in_Qi_Flows"].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (gen 1)) 3)
    ((☯ (gen (string-append "hello" " " "there")))
     3 4 5)
    ((☯ (gen 1 2)) 3)
  ]
}

@deftogether[(
  @defidform[△]
  @defidform[sep]
  @defform[#:link-target? #f
           (△ flo)]
  @defform[#:link-target? #f
           (sep flo)]
)]{
  Separate the input list into its component values. This is the inverse of @racket[▽].

  When used in parametrized form with a presupplied @racket[flo], this flow accepts any number of inputs, where the first is expected to be the list to be unraveled. In this form, the flow separates the list into its component values and passes each through @racket[flo] along with the remaining input values.

  @racket[△] and @racket[▽] often allow you to use functions directly where you might otherwise need to use an indirection like @racket[apply] or @racket[list].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (~> △ +)) (list 1 2 3 4))
    ((☯ (~> △ (>< sqr) ▽)) (list 1 2 3 4))
    ((☯ (~> (△ +) ▽)) (list 1 2 3) 10)
    (struct kitten (name age) #:transparent)
    ((☯ (~> (△ kitten) ▽))
     (list "Ferdinand" "Imp" "Zacky") 0)
  ]
}

@deftogether[(
  @defidform[▽]
  @defidform[collect]
)]{
  Collect the input values into a list. This is the inverse of @racket[△].

  @racket[△] and @racket[▽] often allow you to use functions directly where you might otherwise need to use an indirection like @racket[apply] or @racket[list].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (~> ▽ (string-join ""))) "a" "b" "c")
    ((☯ (~> △ (>< sqr) ▽)) (list 1 2 3 4))
  ]
}

@defform[(esc expr)]{
  Escape to the host language to evaluate @racket[expr] which is expected to yield a @tech{flow}. @racket[(☯ (esc (☯ expr)))] is equivalent to @racket[(☯ expr)].

  Also see @secref["Using_Racket_to_Define_Flows"].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (esc (λ (x) (+ 2 x)))) 3)
  ]
}

@defform[(clos flo)]{
  A flow that generates a flow as a value. Any inputs to the @racket[clos] flow are available to @racket[flo] when it is applied to inputs, i.e. it is analogous to a @hyperlink["https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Closure.html"]{closure} in Racket.

  We typically describe flows using Qi, while @racket[esc] allows us to describe a flow using the host language. In either case, the flow simply @emph{operates} on runtime inputs. In some cases, though, we need to generate a flow as a @emph{value} to be used later, for instance, when the flow is parametrized by inputs not available until runtime. @racket[clos] allows us to define and produce such a flow using Qi.

  Without @racket[clos], we could still accomplish this by using @racket[esc] and producing a function value (i.e. a @racket[lambda]) as the result of the function we define -- but this would mean that we must employ the host language to describe the flow rather than Qi.

  When used within a threading form (i.e. @racket[~>] or @racket[~>>]), @racket[clos] incorporates the pre-supplied input in accordance with the threading direction at the site of its definition.

  @margin-note{A flow defined using @racket[clos] retains @emph{all} of the inputs from the definition site. Filtering the inputs @emph{within} the flow definition filters the aggregate inputs available at runtime invocation -- not the inputs available at the definition site. If you only need access to a subset of definition-site inputs, these must be filtered prior to passing them in to @racket[clos].}

  See @secref["Converting_a_Function_to_a_Closure"] in the field guide for more tips on using closures.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs

@defform[(and flo ...)]{
  Output true if the inputs, when considered together, satisfy each of the @racket[flo] predicates.

    ((☯ (and positive? odd?)) 9)
    ((☯ (and (all odd?) <)) 3 7 11)

  ]
}

@defform[(and% flo ...)]{
  Output true if the inputs, when considered independently or "in parallel," satisfy each of the respective @racket[flo] predicates. Equivalent to @racket[(~> (== flo ...) AND)], except that the identifier @racket[_] when used in the present form indicates that you "don't care" about the corresponding input in determining the result (whereas it ordinarily indicates the identity transformation).

  A Boolean OR gate, this outputs the disjunction of the inputs.

Note that the symbol form uses Unicode @code{0x2225} corresponding to LaTeX's @code{\parallel}. We do not use the easier-to-type @racket[||] symbol (that was formerly used here in older versions of Qi) as that is treated as the @seclink["default-readtable-dispatch" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{empty symbol} by Racket's reader, which could cause problems in some cases.

  Compose flows in sequence, from left to right. In the metaphor of an analog electrical circuit, you could think of this as a wire.

  @racket[~>] "threads" the arguments in the leading position, while @racket[~>>] threads them in the trailing position. Argument positions may also be explicitly indicated via a @seclink["Templates_and_Partial_Application"]{template}, either individually or en masse.

@defform[(relay flo ...)]
)]{
  Compose flows in parallel, so that inputs are passed through the corresponding @racket[flo]'s individually. The number of @racket[flo]s must be the same as the number of runtime inputs.

  In the common case of @code{1 × 1} @racket[flo]s (i.e. where the flows each accept one input and produce one output), the number of outputs will be the same as the number of inputs, but as @seclink["What_is_a_Flow_"]{flows can be nonlinear}, this is not necessarily the case in general.

  See also the field guide entry on the @seclink["Bindings_are_an_Alternative_to_Nonlinearity"]{relationship between bindings and nonlinearity}.

  A "tee" junction, this forks the input values into multiple copies, each set of which is passed through a @racket[flo] "in parallel." Equivalent to @racket[(☯ (~> (fanout N) (== flo ...)))], where @racket[N] is the number of @racket[flo]'s.

  Select or block inputs by index, outputting the selection or remainder, respectively. @racket[index] is @emph{1-indexed}, that is, for instance, in order to select the first and the third input, we would use @racket[(select 1 3)].

@examples[

                              [else flow-expr]])]{
  The flow analogue of @racket[cond], this is a dispatcher where the condition and consequent expressions are all flows which operate on the switch inputs.

  Typically, each of the component flows -- conditions and consequents both -- receives all of the original inputs to the @racket[switch]. This can be changed by using a @racket[divert] clause, which takes two flow arguments, the first of whose outputs go to all of the condition flows, and the second of whose outputs go to all of the consequent flows. This can be useful in cases where multiple values flow, but only some of them are predicated upon, and others (or all of them) inform the actions to be taken. Using @racket[(divert _ _)] is equivalent to not using it. @racket[%] is a symbolic alias for @racket[divert] -- parse it visually not as the percentage sign, but as a convenient way to depict a "floodgate" diverting values down different channels.

  When the @racket[=>] form is used in a consequent flow, the consequent receives @emph{N + 1} inputs, where the first input is the result of the predicate flow, and the remaining @racket[N] inputs are the a priori inputs to the consequent flow (which are typically the original inputs to the switch, unless modulated with a @racket[divert] clause). This form is analogous to the @racket[=>] symbol when used in a @racket[cond]. Note that while switch can direct any number of values, we can unambiguously channel the result of the predicate to the first input of the consequent here because it is guaranteed to be a single value (otherwise it wouldn't be a predicate).

  If none of the conditions are met, this flow produces @emph{the input values}, unchanged, except if a @racket[divert] clause is specified, in which case it produces the input values transformed under @racket[consequent-gate-flow]. If you need a specific value such as @racket[(void)] or would prefer to output no values, indicate this explicitly via e.g. @racket[[else void]] or @racket[[else ⏚]].

When the inputs do not satisfy @racket[condition-flo], @racket[return-flo] is applied to the inputs to yield the result at that terminating step. If the condition is satisfied and there are no further values, the loop terminates naturally.

  If unspecified, @racket[condition-flo] defaults to @racket[#t], @racket[combine-flo] defaults to @racket[_], and @racket[return-flo] defaults to @racket[⏚].

@defform[(loop2 condition-flo map-flo combine-flo)]{
  A "tail-recursive" looping form, this passes the result at each step as a flow input to the next, alongside the inputs to the subsequent step, simply evaluating to the result flow on the last step.

@defform[#:link-target? #f
         (feedback (while cond-flo) (then then-flo) flo)]
)]{
  Pass the inputs @racket[N] times through @racket[flo] by "feeding back" the outputs each time. If a @racket[while] clause is specified in place of a value, then the outputs are fed back as long as @racket[cond-flo] is true. If the optional @racket[then] form is specified, @racket[then-flo] will be invoked on the outputs at the end after the loop has completed.

  If used in identifier form simply as @racket[feedback], it treats the first three inputs as @racket[cond-flo], @racket[then-flo], and @racket[flo], respectively, and all three are expected. The remaining inputs are treated as the data inputs being acted upon.

  For practical advice on using @racket[feedback], see @secref["Effectively_Using_Feedback_Loops"] in the field guide.

@section{Exceptions}

@defform[(try flo [error-predicate-flo error-handler-flo] ...)]{
  A dispatcher for handling exceptions that works similarly to @racket[switch], this attempts @racket[flo] and simply produces its results if successful. Otherwise, if an exception is raised, the exception is provided to each of the @racket[error-predicate-flo]'s in turn, and for the first predicate that returns true, the corresponding @racket[error-handler-flo] is invoked with the input arguments.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (~> (9) (try (/ 3) [exn:fail? 0]) add1)

@defidform[amp]

)]{
  The flow analogue to @racket[map], this maps each input individually under @racket[flo]. As flows may generate any number of output values, unlike @racket[map], the number of outputs need not equal the number of inputs here.

  If used in identifier form simply as @racket[><], it treats the first input as @racket[flo].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (>< sqr)) 1 2 3)
    ((☯ ><) sqr 1 2 3)
    ((☯ (>< (-< _ _))) 1 2 3)
  ]
}

@deftogether[(
@defidform[pass]
@defform[#:link-target? #f
         (pass condition-flo)]
)]{
  The flow analogue to @racket[filter], this filters the input values individually under @racket[condition-flo], yielding only those values that satisfy it.

  If used in identifier form simply as @racket[pass], it treats the first input as @racket[condition-flo] and the remaining inputs as the values to be filtered.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (pass positive?)) 1 -2 3)
    ((☯ pass) positive? 1 -2 3)
  ]
}

@deftogether[(

         (<< flo)]
@defform[(>> flo init-flo)]
@defform[#:link-target? #f
         (>> flo)]
)]{
  The flow analogues to @racket[foldr] and @racket[foldl] (respectively -- the side on which the symbols "fold" corresponds to the type of fold), these fold over input @emph{values} rather than an input list. The @racket[init-flo] is optional; if it isn't provided, @racket[flo] itself is invoked with no arguments to obtain the init value, to borrow a convention from the Clojure language.

  @racket[flo] receives the current input value in the first position, followed by the accumulated values, and may generate any number of output values. These output values are fed back as accumulated values for the next iteration if input values remain to be processed; otherwise, they are produced as the output of the flow.

  @racket[init-flo] is expected to be a @emph{flow} that will generate the initial values for the fold, and will be invoked with no inputs for this purpose at runtime. It is done this way to support having multiple initial values or no initial values, rather than specifically one.

    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (<< +)) 1 2 3 4)
    ((☯ (<< string-append)) "a" "b" "c" "d")

@deftogether[(
  @defform[(ε side-effect-flo flo)]
  @defform[#:link-target? #f (ε side-effect-flo)]
  @defform[(effect side-effect-flo flo)]
  @defform[#:link-target? #f (effect side-effect-flo)]
)]{
  Pass the inputs through @racket[flo] but also independently to @racket[side-effect-flo]. The results of the latter, if any, are grounded, so they would have no effect on downstream flows, which would only receive the results of @racket[flo]. Equivalent to @racket[(-< (~> side-effect-flo ⏚) flo)].

  Use @racket[(ε side-effect-flo)] to just perform a side effect without modifying the input, equivalent to @racket[(-< (~> side-effect-flo ⏚) _)].

  Remember that, as the side-effect flow is based on a tee junction, it must handle as many inputs as the main flow. For instance, if you were to use @racket[displayln] as the side-effect, it wouldn't work if more than one value were flowing, and you'd get an inscrutable error resembling:

@codeblock{
; displayln: contract violation
;   expected: output-port?
;   given: 1
;   argument position: 2nd
;   other arguments...:
;    1
}

  As @racket[displayln] expects a single input, you'd need to use @racket[(>< displayln)] for this side-effect in general.

  If you are interesting in using @racket[effect] to debug a flow, see the section on @secref["Debugging" #:doc '(lib "qi/scribblings/qi.scrbl")] in the field guide for more strategies.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (~> (ε displayln sqr) add1)) 3)
    ((☯ (~> (ε (>< displayln) *) add1)) 3 5)
  ]
}

@defidform[apply]{
  Analogous to @racket[apply], this treats the first input as a flow and passes the remaining inputs through it, producing the output that the input flow would produce if the argument flows were passed through it directly.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ apply) + 1 2 3)
  ]
}

@section{Identifiers}

Identifiers in a flow context are interpreted as @tech/reference{variables} whose @tech/reference{values} are expected to be @seclink["lambda" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/guide/guide.scrbl")]{functions}. In other words, any named function may be used directly as a flow.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ +) 1 2 3)
    ((☯ add1) 3)
  ]

@section{Literals}

Literals and quoted values (including syntax-quoted values) in a flow context are interpreted as flows generating them. That is, for instance, @racket[5] in a flow context is equivalent to @racket[(gen 5)].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ "hello") 1 2 3)
  ]

@section{Templates and Partial Application}

A parenthesized expression that isn't one of the Qi forms is treated as @emph{partial function application}, where the syntactically-indicated arguments are pre-supplied to yield a partially applied function that is applied to the input values at runtime.

Usually, the @racket[_] symbol indicates the trivial or identity flow, simply passing the inputs through unchanged. Within a partial application, however, the underscore indicates argument positions. If the expression includes a double underscore, @racket[__], then it is treated as a simple template such that the runtime arguments (however many there may be) are passed at the position indicated by the placeholder. Another type of template is indicated by using one or more single underscores. In this case, a specific number of runtime arguments are expected (corresponding to the number of blanks indicated by underscores). This more fine-grained template is powered under the hood by @other-doc['(lib "fancy-app/main.scrbl")].

@bold{N.B.}: In the examples below, and elsewhere in these docs, for some reason the double underscore renders in such a way that it is indistinguishable from a single underscore. You will have to infer from context which one is being used, that is, if more than one argument is being passed to a position, it must be a double underscore!

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ (* 3)) 7)
    ((☯ (string-append "c")) "a" "b")
    ((☯ (string-append "a" _ "c")) "b")
    ((☯ (< 5 _ 10)) 7)
    ((☯ (< 5 _ 7 _ 10)) 6 9)
    ((☯ (< 5 _ 7 _ 10)) 6 11)
    ((☯ (< 5 __ 10)) 6 7 8)
    ((☯ (< 5 __ 10)) 6 7 11)
  ]

@section{Utilities}

@defidform[count]{
  The arity of the flow. Analogous to @racket[length] for lists, this counts the values in the flow.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ count) 5)
    ((☯ (~> (-< _ _ _) count)) 5)
  ]
}

@defidform[live?]{
  Check if there are any values flowing -- evaluates to @racket[true] if there are, and @racket[false] otherwise.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    ((☯ live?) 5)
    (~> (5) (-< _ _ _) live?)
    (~> (5) (-< _ _ _) ⏚ live?)
    (~> (8 "hello" 3 'boo 4) (pass number?) (if live? min #f))
    (~> ("hello" 'boo) (pass number?) (if live? min #f))
  ]
}

@defform[(rectify v ...)]{
  Check if the flow is @racket[live?], and if it isn't, then ensure that the values @racket[v ...] are produced. Equivalent to @racket[(if live? _ (gen v ...))].

  A flow may sometimes produce @emph{no values}. In such cases, depending on how the output of the flow is used, it may be desirable to ensure that it returns some default value or values instead. @racket[rectify] produces the original output of the flow unchanged if there is any output, and otherwise outputs @racket[v ...].

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (~> (5) (rectify #f))
    (~> (5) ⏚ (rectify #f))
    (~> (8 "hello" 3 'boo 4) (pass number?) (rectify 0) min)
    (~> ("hello" 'boo) (pass number?) (rectify 0) min)
  ]
}

@section{Language Extension}

This way to extend the language is intended for use in @bold{legacy versions of Racket only}, that is, versions 8.2 or earlier. Qi now (as of Racket 8.3) offers "first class" macro extensibility where there is no need for the special prefix, "qi:". See @secref["Qi_Macros"] for more. Prefix-based macros (i.e. the kind discussed in the present section) should be considered @bold{deprecated} on versions 8.3 or later.

@defform[(qi:* expr ...)]{
  A form with a name starting with "qi:" is treated in a special way -- it is simply left alone during the macro expansion phase as far as Qi is concerned, as it is expected to be a macro written by a third party that will expand into a @emph{Racket} expression that is usable as a flow (i.e. similar to the @racket[esc] form). That is, such a form must expand either to a flow specified using Qi and wrapped with @racket[☯], or to a @seclink["lambda" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/guide/guide.scrbl")]{lambda} containing arbitrary Racket code.

 This allows you to extend the Qi language locally without requiring changes to be made in the library itself.

@examples[
    #:eval eval-for-docs
    (define-syntax-rule (qi:square flo)
      (☯ (feedback 2 flo)))
    (~> (2 3) + (qi:square sqr))
  ]
